    "I found dealing with GitHub intimidating. I didn't understand all the pushing, pulling, cloning and forking. I didn't know where to go to do any of that Tug-of-War crap. Turns out, the solution is rather simple. We have two dozen easy ways to accomplish things on GitHub which makes GitHub confusing for the novice, and difficult to Google. It's hard to understand what you read online since everyone's doing the same simple thing but in several different ways.\n",
