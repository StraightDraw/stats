    "First let's show a nice animation that visually describes the definition of convex polygons.\n",

    "\n",
    "## How to Code It\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below is broken into sections to better illustrate what produced the animation above. One key point to understand is the two height/width arguments. The first pair sets the viewing window on Geogebra in your actual drawing itself. Play around with these until you get the viewing rectangle you want. The baseline point is the top-left corner of the Geogebra window. Increase width to more content to the right. Increase height to more content at the bottom.\n",
